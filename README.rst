apilogs
=======

``apilogs`` is a fork of the excellent `awslogs <https://github.com/jorgebastida/awslogs>`_ project with specific customizations suited to querying and streaming logs for
Serverless APIs using `Amazon API Gateway <https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/>`_ and `AWS Lambda <https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/>`_.

Simply provide an API Gateway API ID and Stage name and `apilogs` will automatically aggregate log events from all log streams for your API Gateway API as well as all Lambda function log streams attached to your API.

Installation/Running
-------
$ pip install apilogs

i.e. stream logs for your Serverless API:
    $ apilogs get --api-id xyz123 --stage prod --watch

Grep for errors one hour ago using credentials from AWS CLI profile "myprofile":
    $ apilogs get --api-id xyz123 --stage test2 --profile myprofile --aws-region us-east-1 --start='2h ago' --end='1h ago' | grep "ERROR"

Features
--------

* Aggregate logs from across streams.

  - Aggregate all streams in a group.
  - Aggregate streams matching a regular expression.

* Colored output.

  - Highlight found text in logs

* List existing groups

  - ``$ apilogs groups``

* List existing streams

  - ``$ apilogs streams /var/log/syslog``

* Watch logs as they are created

  - ``$ apilogs get /var/log/syslog ALL --watch``


* Truncate logs as they are shown

  - ``$ apilogs get /var/log/syslog ALL --no-wrap``

* Human-friendly time filtering:

  - ``--start='23/1/2015 14:23'``
  - ``--start='2h ago'``
  - ``--start='2d ago'``
  - ``--start='2w ago'``
  - ``--start='2d ago' --end='1h ago'``

* Retrieve event metadata:

  - ``--timestamp`` Prints the creation timestamp of each event.
  - ``--ingestion-time`` Prints the ingestion time of each event.

Options
-------

* ``apilogs groups``: List existing groups
* ``apilogs streams GROUP``: List existing streams withing ``GROUP``
* ``apilogs get GROUP [STREAM_EXPRESSION]``: Get logs matching ``STREAM_EXPRESSION`` in ``GROUP``.

  - Expressions can be regular expressions or the wildcard ``ALL`` if you want any and don't want to type ``.*``.

**Note:** You need to provide to all these options a valid AWS region using ``--aws-region`` or ``AWS_REGION`` env variable.


Time options
-------------

While querying for logs you can filter events by ``--start`` ``-s`` and ``--end`` ``-e`` date.

* By minute:

  - ``--start='2m'`` Events generated two minutes ago.
  - ``--start='1 minute'`` Events generated one minute ago.
  - ``--start='5 minutes'`` Events generated five minutes ago.

* By hours:

  - ``--start='2h'`` Events generated two hours ago.
  - ``--start='1 hour'`` Events generated one hour ago.
  - ``--start='5 hours'`` Events generated five hours ago.

* By days:

  - ``--start='2d'`` Events generated two days ago.
  - ``--start='1 day'`` Events generated one day ago.
  - ``--start='5 days'`` Events generated five days ago.

* By weeks:

  - ``--start='2w'`` Events generated two week ago.
  - ``--start='1 week'`` Events generated one weeks ago.
  - ``--start='5 weeks'`` Events generated five week ago.

* Using specific dates:

  - ``--start='23/1/2015 12:00'`` Events generated after midday  on the 23th of January 2015.
  - ``--start='1/1/2015'`` Events generated after midnight on the 1st of January 2015.
  - ``--start='Sat Oct 11 17:13:46 UTC 2003'`` You can use detailed dates too.

  Note, for time parsing awslogs uses `dateutil <https://dateutil.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_.

* All previous examples are applicable for  ``--end`` ``-e`` too.

Filter options
----------------

You can use ``--filter-pattern`` if you want to only retrieve logs which match one CloudWatch Logs Filter pattern.
This is helpful if you know precisely what you are looking for, and don't want to download the entire stream.

For example, if you only want to download only the report events from a Lambda stream you can run::

  $ apilogs get my_lambda_group --filter-pattern="[r=REPORT,...]"

How to provide AWS credentials to apilogs
------------------------------------------

Although, the most straightforward thing to do might be use ``--aws-access-key-id`` and ``--aws-secret-access-key`` or ``--profile``, this will eventually become a pain in the ass.

* If you only have one ``AWS`` account, my personal recommendation would be to configure `aws-cli <http://aws.amazon.com/cli/>`_. ``apilogs`` will use those credentials if available.
* If you have multiple ``AWS`` accounts or you don't want to setup ``aws-cli``, I would recommend you to use `envdir <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/envdir>`_ in order to make ``AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`` and ``AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`` available to ``apilogs``.
